## Overview of Statistical Analysis

Following a weekend of Citibiking throughout New York City, Kate thought of a brilliant idea to bring city bikes to her home town of  Iowa. After developing a business plan, an invester offered funding to sponsor her bike dreams but requested a statistical overview of New York's Citibike data. The purpose of this analysis is to help Kate visualize NYC Citibike's data through Tableau and tell a story through the data. 

## Results

1. Breakdown of Citibike Users by User Type. 
-The breakdown of the type of Citibike users in NYC are 1 million subscribers and 443,865 customers.

2. Peak Stoptime Hours During the Month of August
- The peak time a Citibike rider stopped their bike journey was at 6:00 pm. 

3. The Total Length of Checkout Time By Hour and Minute
-The total length of checkout time was 40 minutes. 

4. The Length of Checkout Times by Gender 
-The total checkout times for Males was 10 minutes. 
-The total checkout times for Females was 15 minutes. 

5. Count of Citibike Trips By Weekday Per Hour
- Thursdays at 6 pm had the highest amount of trips with 44,905. 

6. Count of Weekday Citibike Trips Per Hour Broken Down By Gender
-The highest amount of trips for Males was Thursdays at 6pm with 30,749 trips. 
-The highest amount of trips for Females was Tuesdays at 5pm with 8,810 trips. 

7. Count of Weekday Citibike Trips Broken Down By Gender and Filtered Through User Type. 
-The highest weekday citibike trip was Male subscribers on a Thursday with 259,316 trips. 

## Summary

After utilizing Tableau to derive insights and create visualizations, the results provided interesting findings. The main takeaway from the data is that Citibike users are mostly Males who are subscribers to the Citibike platform. Although Females also use Citibikes, the Male bike activity is greater. The peak end time for Males on their bike journey is at 6:00 pm and the length of the checkout time is around 15 minutes. Two other additional visualizations that would benefit the investor would be a visualization of the start time of bike journey's divided by gender and the total time of a bike journey from start to end.
